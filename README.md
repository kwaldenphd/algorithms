# Introduction to algorithms lab

This lab builds on previous work with sorting and searching algorithms. In this lab, we will explore how an algorithm script built in Python can automate the process of stripping HTML tags from downloaded web content. 

Instead of executing Python code in blocks or sections, we will write an entire `.py` file that we can execute to automate all the functions or steps outlined in the file. More on this later.

## Lab Goals

- Introduce Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)
- Explain how to use Python to download and save the contents of a web page to your local hard drive
- Learn how to remove the HTML markup from a webpage
- Introduce looping and branching to repeat tasks and test for certain conditions
- Convert a long string to a list of words that canbe sorted, indexed, and counted

# Using Python to Download Web Pages

## What is a URL

## Using Python to Open URLs

## Saving a Web page

# Devising an algorithm

## Explore the HTML

## Identify and sequence patterns

## Outline the algorithm

# Building the algorithm in Python

## Review of Looping and Branching

## Removing HTML Markup

## Building the `stripTags` routine

### `continue` and `return`

# Writing raw text to a Python list

## Open the `.txt` file

## `append` words to a list

# Possible Next Steps

The list of words includes data that is still very messy, even with the HTML tags removed.

Another Programming Historian tutorial walks through how to use Python to normalize the textual data.

- William J. Turkel and Adam Crymble, "Normalizing Textual Data with Python," The Programming Historian 1 (2012), https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/normalizing-data.

With normalized textual data, you could use Python to do things like:
- count word frequency

- analyze keywords in contact using n-grams
